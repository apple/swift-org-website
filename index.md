# Welcome to Swift.org

Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns.

## Why Swift?

### Safe

The most obvious way to write code should also behave in a safe manner. Undefined behavior is the enemy of safety, and developer mistakes should be caught before software is in production. Opting for safety sometimes means Swift will feel strict, but we believe that clarity saves time in the long run.

### Fast

Swift is intended as a replacement for C-based languages (C, C++, and Objective-C). As such, Swift must be comparable to those languages in performance for most tasks. Performance must also be predictable and consistent, not just fast in short bursts that require clean-up later. There are lots of languages with novel features — being fast is rare.

### Expressive

Swift benefits from decades of advancement in computer science to offer syntax that is a joy to use, with modern features developers expect. But Swift is never done. We will monitor language advancements and embrace what works, continually evolving to make Swift even better.

## Use cases

### Apple platforms

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language on macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that is optimized to run lightning-fast.

### Server

Ever dreamed of using the same programming language on both your mobile applications and their server back-ends? Swift's small footprint, quick startup time, and deterministic performance make it specifically suitable for Server applications.

## Getting involved

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Swift. Contributing doesn’t just mean submitting pull requests—there are many different ways for you to get involved, including answering questions on the forums, reporting or triaging bugs, and participating in the Swift evolution process.

No matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn what’s expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading the [Community Overview](/community/). If you’re contributing code, you should also know how to build and run Swift from the repository, as described in [Source Code](/source-code/).

### Design

Anyone with a good idea can help shape the future features and direction of the language. To reach the best possible solution to a problem, we discuss and iterate on ideas in a public forum.

</div>

### Code

Swift welcomes developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse community has more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produces more great code.

### Troubleshoot

Reporting issues is a great way for anyone to help improve Swift. Nearly as important is triaging those issues to ensure that they are reproducible, small, and unique.
