## Why Swift?

<ul class="why-swift-list">
  <li>
    <h3>Safe</h3>
    <p>
      Swift prioritizes safety and clarity, ensuring that code behaves in a safe manner while also promoting clear and concise programming practices.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Fast</h3>
    <p>
      Swift aims to replace C-based languages (C, C++, and Objective-C) and match their performance, while maintaining consistency and predictability.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Expressive</h3>
    <p>
      Swift builds upon decades of advancements in computer science, providing a modern syntax that is a joy to use.
    </p>
  </li>

## Use cases

<ul class="use-cases">
  <li>
    <h3>Apple platforms</h3>
    <p>
      Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language on macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that is optimized to run lightning-fast.
