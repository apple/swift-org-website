Swift 5.9 is now officially released! ðŸŽ‰ <!-- TODO: Summary of what's included in the release -->

Thank you to everyone in the Swift community who made this release possible. Your Swift Forums discussions, bug reports, pull requests, educational content, and other contributions are always appreciated!

<!-- TODO: Link to Swift 5.9 showcase resource -->

[The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/) book has been updated for Swift 5.9 and is now published with DocC. This is the official Swift guide and a great entry point for those new to Swift. The Swift community also maintains a number of [translations](/documentation/#translations).

If youâ€™re new to Swift, [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) is the official Swift guide and has been updated for version 5.9. The Swift community maintains a number of [translations](https://www.swift.org/documentation/#translations).

## Language and Standard Library

Swift 5.9 tackles three long-desired features that allow you to express things you couldn't easily do before.

Swift now supports [macros](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/macros.md), which allow developers to reduce repetitive boilerplate and create new language features that can be distributed as a Swift package. Using a macro is easy and natural; macros can either be called with the function-like freestanding `#macroName` syntax or attached to declarations with an `@MacroName` attribute, so they work just like built-in language features but can't be mistaken for normal code. Implementing a macro uses a powerful and flexible approach: Macros are implemented by writing Swift functions that use the SwiftSyntax library to generate code to insert into the source file. Macros make it easy for your library's users to adopt powerful capabilities that adapt to the code they're used in, like [the new `Observation` module](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0395-observability.md), which allows Swift classes to automatically notify other code when their properties change.

Swift also has new features to help developers fine-tune memory management behavior in performance-critical code. The [`consume` operator](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0366-move-function.md) tells Swift to de-initialize a variable and transfer its contents without copying it. The [`consuming` and `borrowing` parameter modifiers](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0377-parameter-ownership-modifiers.md) provide hints that Swift can use to eliminate unnecessary copying and reference-counting operations when passing a parameter. And [noncopyable structs and enums](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0390-noncopyable-structs-and-enums.md) allow you to create types which, like a class, represent a specific resource that can't be meaningfully copied when it's assigned, but like a struct or enum, do not need to be reference-counted because only one storage location can own the instance at a time.

The last of these major features is [parameter packs](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0393-parameter-packs.md). These let you write generic types and functions which work over not just any type, but any _number_ of types. For example, this `all(_:)` function lets you check whether any number of `Optional` values are `nil`, even if the `Optional`s wrap different types:

```swift
func all<each Wrapped>(_ optional: repeat (each Wrapped)?) -> (repeat each Wrapped)? {
    // Implementation provided below
}

let optionalInt: Int? = 1
let optionalDouble: Double? = 2.5
let optionalString: String? = nil

if let (int, double, string) = all(optionalInt, optionalDouble, optionalString) {
    print(int, double, string)
}
else {
    print("got a nil")
}
```

<details markdown="1" class="download">
  <summary>Implementation of <code>all</code></summary>

```swift
/// Takes any number of `Optional` arguments and returns `nil` if any of them
/// are `nil`, or a tuple of their values if all of them are non-`nil`.
func all<each Wrapped>(_ optional: repeat (each Wrapped)?) -> (repeat each Wrapped)? {
  /// Accumulates the results from the `checkNilness(of:)` helper function.
  var anyAreNil = false

  // Check if any of the arguments in `each optional` is nil by running this
  // `checkNilness(of:)` function on each argument.
  func checkNilness<OneWrapped>(of oneOptional: OneWrapped?) {
      if oneOptional == nil {
          anyAreNil = true
      }
  }
  repeat checkNilness(of: each optional)

  // Did `checkNilness(of:)` find any nils? If so, return nil early.
  if anyAreNil {
      return nil
  }

  // Otherwise, we can safely force-unwrap all of the arguments and form a tuple
  // from the unwrapped values.
  return (repeat (each optional)!)
}
```

</details>

What's more, these features are all usable today in Swift 5.9, but they are not finished growing. Each one is too large to fully implement in a single release; we're excited about what you can already do with them in Swift 5.9, but we're even more excited to have laid the foundations for better things to come.

In addition to these major features, Swift 5.9 also includes lots of smaller refinements to the language. The one developers will probably use most often is [`if` and `switch` expressions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0380-if-switch-expressions.md), which lets you assign the result of a single-expression `if` or `switch` statement to a variable:

```swift
statusBar.text = if !hasConnection { "Disconnected" }
                 else if let error = lastError { error.localizedDescription }
                 else { "Ready" }
```

Swift 5.9 also adds a [new `package` access level](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0386-package-access-modifier.md) that lets other modules in the same package access APIs, but hides them from code outside the package; it's great for splitting up large modules into several smaller ones without exposing internals to the package's clients. Developers using Swift Concurrency may appreciate the [more convenient `DiscardingTaskGroup` types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0381-task-group-discard-results.md) for task groups that don't generate results and the advanced [custom actor executors](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0392-custom-actor-executors.md) feature for controlling the exact environment that an actor is run in.

A full list of Swift 5.9's Evolution proposals can be found at the end of this post.

## Developer Experience

### Crash Handling

On Linux, the Swift runtime will now catch program crashes and Swift runtime errors and display a backtrace on the program's output. The backtracer is out-of-process and includes support for `async` functions.

This feature is also available on macOS, although there it is disabled by default (it can be enabled by setting `SWIFT_BACKTRACE=enable=yes`) and you need to ensure that your program is signed with the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement.

### Debugging

In Swift 5.9, we introduced a couple of new features to [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/) and the Swift compiler aimed at making Swift debugging faster and more reliable.

The `p` and `po` commands will now bypass the Swift compiler when evaluating simple expressions, which will make printing local and member variables as fast as using the `frame variable` or `v` command.

Swift expressions can now refer to generic type parameters. This allows setting a conditional breakpoint in a generic function that only triggers when a type parameter is instantiated with a specific concrete type.

Finally, the debug info produced by the Swift compiler is now more precise when it comes to scoping of local variables.

For a more detailed discussion and examples of how to use these new features we will be publishing a separate blog focussing on debugging Swift 5.9 next week!

## Ecosystem

### Swift Package Manager

Following are some highlights from the changes introduced to the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) in Swift 5.9:

- SwiftPM packages can now use `package` as a new access modifier, allowing accessing symbols in another target / module within the same package without making it public.

- Introducing `CompilerPluginSupport` module for defining macro targets. Macro targets allow authoring and distribution of custom Swift macros such as [expression macros](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0382-expression-macros.md).

- Introducing new `.embedInCode` resource rule for embedding the contents of the resource into the executable by generating a byte array, e.g.

  ```
  struct PackageResources {
    static let my_resource: [UInt8] = [104,101,108,108,111,32,119,111,114,108,100,10]
  }
  ```

- `allowNetworkConnections(scope:reason:)` setting giving a command plugin permissions to access the network. Permissions can be scoped to Unix domain sockets in general or specifically for Docker, as well as local or remote IP connections which can be limited by port. For non-interactive use cases, there is also a `--allow-network-connections` commandline flag to allow network connections for a particular scope.

- SwiftPM can now publish to a registry following the publishing spec as defined in [SE-0391](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0391-package-registry-publish.md). SwiftPM also gains support for signed packages. Trust-on-first-use (TOFU) check which includes only fingerprints (e.g., checksums) previously has been extended to include signing identities, and it is enforced for source archives as well as package manifests.

- New `swift experimental-sdk` experimental command is now available for managing Swift SDK bundles that follow the format described in [SE-0387](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0387-cross-compilation-destinations.md).

See the [Swift Package Manager changelog](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#swift-59) for the complete list of changes.

### Swift Syntax

[swift-syntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax) has become an essential tool to create macros in Swift 5.9. In addition to the introduction of the modules that allow the creation of macros, swift-syntax has received huge focus on quality:

- The documentation of swift-syntax has been greatly expanded and can be viewed at [swiftpackageindex.com](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-syntax)

- The names of all syntax nodes and their children have been audited to be more consistent and accurately reflect the Swift language.

- The error messages produced by the new SwiftParser have been greatly improved and it now produces better errors than the C++ parser in almost all cases.

- As part of the Google Summer of Code project, incremental parsing has been introduced to swift-syntax, allowing e.g. an editor to only reparse those parts of a syntax tree that have changed.

Over the last year, swift-syntax has been a huge success as an open source project. Since the release of Swift 5.8, more than 30 distinct open source contributors have contributed to the package accounting for more than 30% of the commits. And community tools like [swift-ast-explorer.com](https://swift-ast-explorer.com) are an invaluable tool to explore and understand the SwiftSyntax tree. Thanks to everyone who contributed!

### C++ Interoperability

Swift 5.9 supports bidirectional interoperability with C++ and Objective-C++. You can now use a subset of C++ APIs in Swift and Swift APIs from C++. For information on enabling C++ interoperability and the supported language subset, please refer to the [documentation](/documentation/cxx-interop/).

C++ interoperability is an actively evolving feature of Swift and developed by the focused [C++ Interoperability Workgroup](/cxx-interop-workgroup/). Certain aspects of the design and functionality might change in future releases of Swift, as the Swift community gathers feedback from real world adoption in mixed Swift and C++ codebases.

Join the Swift community and the C++ Interoperability Workgroup to provide feedback and help shape the evolution of the feature.
