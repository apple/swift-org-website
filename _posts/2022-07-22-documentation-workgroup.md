title: Announcing the Documentation Workgroup
author: franklinsch

I’m thrilled to announce the formation of the Swift Documentation Workgroup!

Documentation is an integral part of writing code and there has been a lot of
excitement from the community around delivering great resources for crafting
delightful documentation.

## Goals

The Swift Documentation Workgroup aims to deliver a great documentation
experience for the Swift language and ecosystem with the following goals:

* Guide development for documentation tooling such as Swift-DocC to benefit the
  entire ecosystem
* Define processes that govern contributions to documentation tooling

The workgroup will work to drive a cohesive documentation experience across
Swift. Over time, the workgroup will help define guidelines for writing great
documentation and participate in the documentation experience for the Swift
language itself.

### Diversity in Swift

The workgroup will actively help developers that would like to participate in
Swift’s documentation experience with a goal of lowering the barrier to make
technical contributions to the project. To that effect, the workgroup will be
an active member of the [Swift Mentorship
Program](/blog/swift-mentorship-program), providing
direct guidance to members of the community. Just like other Swift workgroups,
the Diversity in Swift team will work with the Swift Documentation Workgroup to
ensure the principles and interests of the entire Swift community are always
considered.

## Next Steps

To learn more and get involved with the Swift Documentation Workgroup:

* Read the Swift Documentation Workgroup [charter](/documentation-workgroup)
* Discuss ideas in the
  [Swift-DocC](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swift-docc) forum
* Use the `@swift-documentation-workgroup` handle to reach out to the workgroup
  directly in forums
