title: Swift joins Google Summer of Code 2024

We're happy to announce that Swift will once again be joining [Google Summer of Code 2024](gsoc)!

Summer of Code is an annual program, organized by Google, which provides hands-on experience for newcomers contributing
to open source projects. Participants usually are students, but do not have to be.

Swift has been participating in Summer of Code since 2019, and every year we've had successful projects,
helping the Swift project among various aspects including the compiler, runtime, and general package and tooling ecosystem.
If you're curious, here are the two most recent project summaries for [2022](gsoc-2022) and [2023](gsoc-2023).

Many GSoC participants become part of the Swift community and keep contributing even as the program ends.
This is the most exciting part for us: helping you become a part of the Swift community!

If you are [eligible](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started), and would like to contribute to Swift during
this year's GSoC, these are the steps to take:

1. Check out the existing [project ideas page](ideas).
2. If a project excites you, [proceed to the forums dedicated GSoC category](forums-gsoc) to discuss the project.
3. Once you are confident in your understanding of the project and how to approach it, prepare an official proposal and submit it to the [GSoC website](gsoc).

You can also come up with your own project ideas. To do so, you'll need to start a discussion thread on the forums and pitch the idea similar to how the existing
ideas are listed on the ideas page. Proposing new ideas is exciting, but more difficult as you'll have to ensure the project gets a mentor willing to take it on.

The forums are also a great resource of past GSoC discussions and projects. In addition to that, you should also read through the ???

Official proposal applications need to be sent through the Summer of Code website. 
Applications start on March 18, 2024, and end on April 2, 2024 at 18:00 UTC.

We look forward to working with you all again this year!
