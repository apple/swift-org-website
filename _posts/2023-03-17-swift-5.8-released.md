title: Swift 5.8 Released!
author: [alexandersandberg]

Swift 5.8 is now officially released! ðŸŽ‰ [Release summary when all content is added...]

Thank you to everyone in the Swift community who made this release possible. Your Swift Forums discussions, bug reports, pull requests, educational content, and other contributions are always appreciated!

For a quick dive into some of whatâ€™s new in Swift 5.8, check out this [playground](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-5-8) put together by Paul Hudson.

[The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/) book has been updated for Swift 5.8 and is now published with DocC. This is the official Swift guide and a great entry point for those new to Swift. The Swift community also maintains a number of [translations](/documentation/#translations).

## Language and Standard Library

[Coming soon...]

You can find the complete list of Swift Evolution proposals that were implemented in Swift 5.8 in the [Swift Evolution Appendix](#swift-evolution-appendix) below.

## Developer Experience

### Improved Result Builder Implementation

The result builder implementation has been re-worked in Swift 5.8 to greatly improve compile-time performance, code completion results, and diagnostics. The Swift 5.8 result builder implementation enforces stricter type inference that matches the semantics in [SE-0289: Result Builders](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0289-result-builders.md), which has an impact on some existing code that relied on invalid type inference.

The new implementation takes advantage of the [extended multi-statement closure inference](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0326-extending-multi-statement-closure-inference.md) introduced in Swift 5.7 and applies the result builder transformation exactly as specified by the result builder proposal - a source-level transformation which is type-checked like a multi-statement closure. Doing so enables the compiler to take advantage of all the benefits of the improved closure inference for result builder transformed code, including optimized type-checking performance (especially in invalid code) and improved error messages.

For more details please refer to [Swift Forums Post](https://forums.swift.org/t/improved-result-builder-implementation-in-swift-5-8/63192) that outlines the improvements and provides more information about invalid inference scenarios.

## Ecosystem

### Swift-DocC

As [announced in February](https://www.swift.org/blog/tspl-on-docc/), The Swift Programming Language book has been converted to Swift-DocC and [open sourced](https://github.com/apple/swift-book), and with it came some enhancements to Swift-DocC itself in the form of [option directives](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/options) you can use to change the behaviour of your generated documentation. Swift-DocC has also added some new directives to create more [dynamic documentation pages](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/api-reference-syntax#creating-custom-page-layouts), including [Grid-based layouts](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/row) and [tab navigators](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/tab).

To take things even further, you can now [customise the appearance of your documentation pages](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/customizing-the-appearance-of-your-documentation-pages) with colour, font, and icon customisations. Navigation also took a step forward with quick navigation, allowing fuzzy in-project search:

Swift-DocC also now supports documenting extensions to types from other modules. This is an opt-in feature, and can be [enabled by adding the `--include-extended-types` flag when using the Swift-DocC plugin](https://apple.github.io/swift-docc-plugin/documentation/swiftdoccplugin/generating-documentation-for-extended-types).

### Swift Package Manager

Here are some of the changes that have been introduced to [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) in Swift 5.8:

- [SE-0362](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0362-piecemeal-future-features.md): Targets can now specify the upcoming language features they require. `Package.swift` manifest syntax has been expanded with an API to include setting `enableUpcomingFeature` and `enableExperimentalFeature` flags at the target level.

- [SE-0378](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0378-package-registry-auth.md): Token authentication when interacting with a package registry is now supported. The `swift package-registry` command has two new subcommands `login` and `logout` for adding/removing registry credentials.

- Exposing an executable product that consists solely of a binary target that is backed by an artifact bundle is now allowed. This allow vending binary executables as their own separate package, independently of the plugins that are using them.

- In packages using tools version 5.8 or later, Foundation is no longer implicitly imported into package manifests. If Foundation APIs are used, the module needs to be imported explicitly.

See the [Swift Package Manager changelog](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#swift-58) for the complete list of changes.

### SwiftSyntax

With the Swift 5.8-aligned release of [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax), SwiftSyntax contains a completely re-written parser that is implemented entirely in Swift instead of relying on the C++ parser to produce a SwiftSyntax tree. While the Swift compiler still uses the old parser implemented in C++, the eventual goal is to eventually replace the old parser entirely. The new parser has a number of advantages:

- Contributing to or depending on SwiftSyntax is now as easy as any other Swift Package Manager package. This greatly lowers the barrier of entry for new contributors and adopters.
- The new parser has been designed with error recovery as a primary goal. It is more tolerant of parsing errors and produces better error messages.
- SwiftSyntaxBuilder allows generating source code in a declarative way using a mixture of result builders and string interpolation. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/blob/release/5.8/Examples/CodeGenerationUsingSwiftSyntaxBuilder.swift).
