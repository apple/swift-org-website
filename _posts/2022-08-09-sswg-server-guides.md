title: Server Guides now on Swift.org
author: 0xTim
---

The [Swift Server Workgroup](/sswg/) has hosted a set of guides for server development on Github for a number of years now. With the open sourcing of the website, we've transitioned the guides to Swift.org! You can find the guides [here](/server/guides/).

The guides cover everything from setting up your environment, building and testing applications, profiling them and deploying them. There are guides for deploying to AWS, both on EC2 and ECS, Digital Ocean, Heroku and GCP. There are also guides for how best to package Docker containers and debug issues in production.

Additionally, the guides contain a section for library authors. These currently cover best practices for logging in libraries at different levels and how to adopt Swift concurrency.

If you have anything you'd like to see covered in the guides you can either [create an issue](https://github.com/apple/swift-org-website/issues/new/choose) or create a post on the forums.
