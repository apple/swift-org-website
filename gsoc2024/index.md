title: Project Ideas for GSoC 2024
---

This page contains a non-exhaustive list of potential project ideas that we are keen to develop during [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). If you would like to apply to GSoC as a contributor, please follow these steps to get started:

1. Read through this page and the Google Summer of Code guides,
2. Identify, or come up with your own project ideas you find interesting.
3. Check out the [Development forum](https://forums.swift.org/c/development) to connect with potential mentors.
- Feel free to mention the project mentors on the forums, when starting a thread about your interest in participating in a specific project they are offering to mentor.

When posting on the forums about GSoC this year, please use the [`gsoc-2024` tag](https://forums.swift.org/tag/gsoc-2024), so it is easy to identify.

## Tips for contacting mentors

The Swift forums are powered by discourse, a discussion forums platform which also has a number of spam avoidance mechanisms built-in. If this is your first time joining the forums, you _may_ not be able to send mentors a direct-message, as this requires a minimum amount of prior participation before the "send private message" feature is automatically enabled.

If you would like to reach out to a mentor privately, rather than making a public forums post, and the forums are not allowing you to send private messages (yet), please reach out to Konrad Malawski at `ktoso AT apple.com` directly via email with the `[gsoc2024]` tag in the email subject and describe the project you would like to work on â€“ and we'll route you to the appropriate mentor.

## Potential Projects

We are currently collecting project ideas on the forums in the dedicated [GSoC](https://forums.swift.org/tag/gsoc-2024).

Potential mentors, please feel free to propose project ideas to this page directly, by [opening a pull request]() over here to the Swift website. 

You can browse previous year's project ideas here: [2023](https://www.swift.org/gsoc2023/), [2022](https://www.swift.org/gsoc2022/), [2021](https://www.swift.org/gsoc2021/), [2020](https://www.swift.org/gsoc2020/), [2019](https://www.swift.org/gsoc2019/).
