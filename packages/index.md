Swift has a rich ecosystem of open source packages that you can easily import into your project using the [Swift Package Manager]({% link package-manager/index.md %}) (SwiftPM).

There are thousands of community-written open source Swift packages to explore through the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/){:target="_blank"}. You can also [create your own package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-standalone-swift-package-with-xcode) for personal use, for private use within your organisation, or as an open source library to share with others.

## Package Ecosystem

The Swift package ecosystem has a broad range of packages to help with networking, testing, building user interfaces, logging, animation, and many more common tasks across all of your projects. Below is a small selection of interesting packages in popular categories from around the community, as well as a hand-picked selection in the Community Showcase.

## Next Steps

The package lists above show a selection of the broader Swift package ecosystem. The [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/) is a community-run search engine for Swift packages with powerful filters to help you find the packages that work for your project. For example, you could search for packages that:

* [Match a search term](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui)
* [Have compatibility with both iOS and macOS platforms](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+platform:ios,macos)
* [Include an executable helper or tool](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+product:executable)
* [Have been created by a specific author](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=author:apple)
