The Swift package ecosystem has thousands of packages to help you with all kinds of tasks across your projects. You'll find networking, testing, UI helpers, logging, animation, and many more packages that work with the [Swift Package Manager]({% link package-manager/index.md %}) (SwiftPM) at the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Package Ecosystem

Browse a small selection of interesting packages in popular categories from around the community, as well as a hand-picked selection of new and notable packages.

## Next Steps

The package lists above show a selection of the broader Swift package ecosystem. The [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/) is a community-run search engine for Swift packages with powerful filters to help you find the packages that work for your project. For example, you could search for packages that:

* [Match a search term](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui)
* [Have compatibility with both iOS and macOS platforms](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+platform:ios,macos)
* [Include an executable helper or tool](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=swiftui+product:executable)
* [Have been created by a specific author](https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=author:apple)
