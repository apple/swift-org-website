## Installing Swift

If you don't have Swift installed, [install it first](/install).

To test that you have Swift installed, run `swift --version` in the terminal.

### Swift Package Manager

When you install Swift youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Swift build tool and package manager, also known as Swift Package Manager, or SwiftPM .

SwiftPM does lots of things:
- Build your project with `swift build`.
- Test your project with `swift test`.
- Run your project with `swift run`.
